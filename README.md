Not so much... for now !

# ProjectEuler
My goal is to improve my skills in logic.
So, when I have time to solve some problems, I do it !

# Why do I publish my scripts ?
Because anyone can already easely find the solutions on internet, and they are always better than mine.
There is no point to cheat, you are only cheating yourself.

After solving a problem, I always search solutions on internet in order to find other ways to solve it (and so to learn), so if I can help someone...

If one day I achieve to be on the first 100, I would wait to publish my solution.
